           <div class="main-text">
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">The Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) framework by Tony Ylwick encourages viewing products from the perspective of the user. It asks a basic question: What job are they trying to get done? </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="quote-text">"People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!"</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">My introduction to the JTBD framework, thanks to a colleague, has been instrumental in focusing on the job to be done and how my products can facilitate these. Users don't wake up excited to use our product; they turn to it because they need a quarter-inch hole.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">The JTBD is also helpful for customer segmentation, helping us understand the needs of different users, particularly in a B2B setting. At REKKI our products serve a diverse range of customers, ranging from the Owner to outsourced accountants. Understanding the unique jobs to be done for each customer segment was crucial in ensuring that our products effectively addressed their challenges and goals.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">Addressing the jobs to be done for users is important, but first, we need to identify who our users are. The JTBD framework categorises users into three groups:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold-text">The Job Executor:</span> This individual uses the product to accomplish a core functional job.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">The Product Lifecycle Support Team:</span> These team members support the product throughout its lifecycle, including installation, transport, maintenance, etc.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">The Buyer:</span> This person makes the final financial purchasing decision.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">In a B2C or D2C setting, a single person might fulfil all three roles. However, in a B2B context, like at REKKI, there tends to be a more distinct separation between these categories, especially in larger businesses. In the payments area at REKKI, accountants typically acted as job executors, a manager often fulfilled the role of the Product Lifecycle Support Team, and the buyer was usually represented by the owner or managing director.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">Following the JTBD framework, having identified our customers, the next step is to define the types of jobs they need to accomplish. The framework identifies five primary job types:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold-text">The Core Functional Job:</span> This is the main task the user seeks to complete, like making monthly payments in the case of accountants.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Related Jobs:</span> These include ancillary tasks before, during, or after the core job, like preparing accounts.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Emotional Jobs:</span> These jobs reflect the user's feelings or desired perception after completing the main task, such as feeling that the process was straightforward.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Consumption Chain Jobs:</span> Focused on the support team, these include setup, storage, and other lifecycle tasks.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">The Purchase Decision Job:</span> This involves the buyer's decision-making process, often based on financial or performance metrics.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">Identifying the JTBD is just the beginning. For instance, knowing accountants need to make payments only provides a starting point. We use the JTBD as an anchor to identify where value can be created. The next step is to consider the 'how', which involves using the Customer-Centered Innovation Map. This map guides us through each stage of the user’s process in completing a job, helping to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for improvement.</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">The Customer-Centered Innovation Map consists of eight steps:</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Define:</span> Identifying and clarifying the need or problem.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Locate:</span> Finding the resources or solutions.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Prepare:</span> Getting ready or setting up for the task.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Confirm:</span> Ensuring everything is correct and in place.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Execute:</span> Carrying out the task or using the solution.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Monitor:</span> Keeping track of progress and performance.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Modify:</span> Making adjustments or improvements as needed.</li>
                <li><span class="bold-text">Conclude:</span> Completing and wrapping up the task.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="para-text">Employing the JTBD framework alongside the Innovation Map helps us understand the steps users take in completing their tasks. When combined with other validation techniques, this approach brings us closer to solving meaningful problems. In the PM role at REKKI, focusing on payments, this translated into streamlining the accountant workflow—simplifying the collection of invoices, categorising spending, facilitating payments, and streamlining reconciliation, among other jobs.</p>
